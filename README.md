# React Projects (Part 1)

• I took the concept of these projects (except the last one) from **freeCodeCamp**, then built them (both JS and CSS) in my own way without seeing their final files.  
• Projects article link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/  
• Their projects link: https://react-projects.netlify.app/  
## • **My projects link : https://hani-alhamad-react-projects-part-1.netlify.app/**  
• I used React JS (details below)* and normal CSS to build these projects.  
• I made their CSS to be compatible with mobile devices (dynamic width).  
• These files are development build, I made production builds and uploaded them to Netlify.  
• Part 2: *not ready yet*



*hooks and other things that I used:  
-1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11: useState.  
-2, 6, 7, 9, 10: useState & useEffect.  
-12, 13: useState, useEffect, useContext.  
-14: useState, useEffect, useContext, useRecucer.  
-15: useState, useEffect, useContext, useCallback, useParams, React Router.  
-used React Icons in many of them as well.
